Percent of New Housing Units within the Growth Centers and Corridors,Percentage of new residential units issued permits in the Imagine Austin growth centers and corridors as compared to the rest of the City of Austin.,Imagine Austin calls for a majority of growth to occur in centers and corridors.,57.61,48.19,31.02,35.35,41.82,70.35,65.05,59.84,57.04,56.35,,percentage
Residential Water Consumption in Gallons per Capita per Day,"This indicator measures water consumption based on metered water volumes used by customers in the residential sector in Gallons Per Capita Per Day (GPCD) for single-family and multifamily water consumption only. The data are based on all single-family and multifamily retail customers according to billing records. This indicates our community's water use and efficiency on the household level, independent of growth in the business or industrial sectors.","The residential gallons per capita use indicator relates to the Sustainably Manage Our Water Resources (SMOWR) Priority Program in that a central focus of the program is on water resource management, water conservation, water reuse, and integrated water resource planning while balancing available resources, evolving technologies, growth trends, and environmental impacts. This indicator reflects residential use, independent of growth in business or industrial sectors. These efforts are reflected in the SMOWR Priority Program work goals including integrated water management, water conservation goals, and drought planning.",82,94,96,80,96,84,79,70,67,71,71,gallons
Intersection Density,"This indicator measures the number of street intersections per square mile. For this calculation, all intersections are weighted evenly, regardless of the number of connecting streets.",Imagine Austin calls for new development that is more walkable and less dependent upon automobile travel. Research shows that intersection density has the most influence on walkability and vehicle miles traveled (VMT).,34.3,34.8,35,35.1,35.3,34.8,35,35.3,35.4,35.5,,intersections per square mile
Prevalence of Diabetes,This indicator measures the prevalence of diabetes among all Travis County adults. It is defined as respondents 18 years and older who were told by a health professional that they have diabetes.,"The chronic diseases associated with the risk factors of tobacco use, poor nutrition, and lack of physical activity (including some cancers, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma) are the underlying causes of most deaths in Travis County.Reducing diabetes is a major goal of Imagine Austin. It is linked to other risk factors such as obesity, poor nutrition, and lack of physical activity.",,,,,8,7.2,9.3,7.2,7.5,10.4,,percent
Median Family Income,"This indicator measures the median family income, which divides the income distribution into two equal parts: one-half of family households falling below the median income and one-half above the median.","Median family incomes have generally been outpaced by median housing prices, and are thus an indication of housing affordability and general prosperity. This indicator may not capture households who have left Austin for more affordable housing options outside of the city limits.",63116,64726,62153,61605,63672,68023,71511,76663,76629,86615,,USD
Homeless Count,This indicator measures the total number of persons who were identified and counted as homeless in the federally mandated Austin/Travis County Annual Point-in-Time Count. By its nature a count only includes persons who are homeless on the day of the count. Point-in-time counts tend to underestimate families and children and do not include individuals living in marginal situations.,"Homeless persons are often subjected to the elements, crime, and other maladies which often results in tragic consequences. Imagine Austin calls for reducing homelessness through supportive housing, mental health services/counseling, and alcohol/drug treatment.",,,1771,2087,2362,2244,2090,1987,1832,2138,2036,persons
Percent of Residents with Health Care Coverage,"This indicator measures the percent of Travis County residents with health care coverage defined as respondents 18 years to 64 years of age who report having any kind of health care coverage, including health insurance, prepaid plans such as HMOs, or government plans such as Medicaid or MAP.

Having health care is associated with improved management of chronic conditions and improved health outcomes.,,,,,,68.5,73.4,79.5,79.6,79.8,,percent
Development Within Edwards Aquifer Zones,"This indicator measures the total developed land area inside the City of Austin and its Extra Territorial Jurisdiction (ETJ) portion of the Edwards Aquifer Recharge and Contributing Zones. The aquifer is an underground layer of porous limestone rock that stores water. The contributing zone is where rainwater flows over land into creeks that “contribute” water to the aquifer downstream. The Recharge Zone contains karst limestone where water infiltrates and flows into karst caves, cracks, and other openings to directly fill or “recharge” the aquifer. There is little to no filtration of water pollutants in this recharge process, and it is therefore critical to reduce the level of intensity of development in these areas and use best management practices to capture, treat, and infiltrate stormwater runoff.","The Edwards Aquifer is perhaps the most important environmentally sensitive asset that provides drinking water and feeds a number of springs in Austin, including Barton Springs and its pool. Imagine Austin calls for directing growth away from the Barton Springs Zone of the Edwards Aquifer recharge and contributing zones and other water-supply watersheds.",,93.7,,99.4,,102.9,,105.9,,107.5,,square miles
Development within the 100 year Floodplain,This indicator measures the number of habitable buildings located in the 100-year floodplain. Floodplains are the areas likely to flood when our creeks rise and flow over their banks. Tracking development within the floodplain allows us to assess the risk to public safety. The 100-year floodplain is only suited for very limited development due to that risk. Numbers go down with City projects to remove or reduce risk to existing structures. Flood regulations prevent more structures from being introduced to the floodplain. Numbers can increase if areas with existing structures are annexed into the corporate city limits.,Imagine Austin calls for actions that reduce the threats flooding poses to public safety and private property.,,,,,,2380,,,,,1816,structures
Percent of New Non-Residential Development within Growth Centers and Corridors,Percentage of new non-residential issued permits in the Imagine Austin growth centers and corridors as compared to the rest of the City of Austin.,Imagine Austin calls for a majority of growth to occur in centers and corridors.,64.8,68.3,54.2,62.8,62.3,80.4,67.8,70.1,74.9,67.3,,percentage
Vehicle Miles Traveled per Capita,This indicator is an estimate of daily vehicle miles traveled on public roads divided by a population. Vehicle miles Traveled (VMT) is a composite measure based on traffic counts from more than one source.,"Reducing VMT is a major goal of Imagine Austin. Increased vehicle use means increased pollution, congestion, delay, and a general breakdown and overuse of our transportation infrastructure. It is a reflection of sprawl development, separation of home and work, and poorly designed infrastructure.",19.33,18.16,17.55,16.75,16.78,15.88,15.98,16.34,,,,miles
Median Housing Values,"This indicator measures the median housing value, which divides the value distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median value of the property (house and lot, mobile home and lot, or condominium unit) and one-half above the median. The data include only units that are owned or on the market and reflect what the property would sell for if it were for sale.",Rising median home values have displaced many longtime residents and discouraged affordable development in central Austin. Imagine Austin calls for the creation of more affordable housing by way of partnerships and incentives to bring families back into the urban core.,195500,210600,214300,214500,217700,22100,234800,255900,282700,308500,,USD
Environmental Integrity Index of Stream Water Quality,"This indicator measure the percentage of watersheds having good or better Environmental Integrity Index (EII) scores. EII is a comprehensive set of water quality measurements which collectively assess watershed health. The EII is a program designed to regularly monitor and assess the chemical, biological, and physical integrity of Austin’s creeks and streams. The overall EII score is a comprehensive reflection of the health and resilience of Austin’s creeks. Austin creeks are now assessed every other year. It can be used to identify where problems occur and may be used to track the success of Austin’s water quality protection efforts over time.","Imagine Austin calls for actions that strengthen flood control, erosion, and water quality programs, incentives, regulations, and enforcement to incorporate best practices and meet or exceed national standards. EII monitoring collects the data essential to track present conditions and progress towards meeting these goals.",,40,,58,,49,,55,,75,,percent
"Participants in Arts, Culture, and Small Business Workshops Hosted by the City of Austin",This indicator measures the number of participants who attended workshops offered by the Economic Development Cultural Arts Division's Small Business Program as well as the Parks and Recreation Department.,"This indicator relates to the level of participation by the community to engage with and learn from City workshops geared toward professional development, education, and community networking designed to support the capacity, sustainability, and growth of the creative sector in Austin.",,,,,,186986,209630,366065,170391,325502,,participants
Amount of Permanently Preserved Land,"This indicator measures the combined acreage of the City of Austin owned or managed lands that are permanently protected from development. This includes the Balcones Canyonlands Preserve (BCP), the Water Quality Protection Lands (WQPL), and nature reserves managed by the Parks Department. These lands are typically set aside for species and water quality protection. The goal of the BCP is to protect and enhance the habitat of endangered and rare species as mitigation for land development, as well as manage these forest ecosystems to protect water, air, and scenic resources. The primary goal of the WQPL is to produce the optimal level of high quality water to recharge the Barton Springs segment of the Edwards Aquifer by managing protected land to restore prairie-savanna ecosystems and healthy riparian corridors. Nature preserves share these and other goals. (Note: Preservation lands owned or managed by county, state, or federal entities, are not included in these totals but further contribute to these regional goals.)","Imagine Austin calls for actions that direct development away from sensitive environmental resources, protect existing open space and natural resources, and improve air and water quality.",41001,41170,42647,42658,42690,42698,43383,44561,44587,44569,44575,acres
Prevalence of Tobacco Use,This indicator measures the prevalence of current tobacco use among all Travis County adults. It is defined as respondents 18 years and older who use smokeless tobacco every day or some days and/or are current smokers.,"The chronic diseases associated with the risk factors of tobacco use, poor nutrition, and lack of physical activity (including some cancers, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma) are the underlying causes of most deaths in Travis County. Tobacco is one of the major causes of death in Travis County.Reducing tobacco use is a major goal of Imagine Austin.",,,,,17.4,15,15.3,12.2,16.6,16.7,,percent

These efforts are reflected in the SMOWR Priority Program work goals including integrated water management, water conservation goals, and drought planning.",151,170,167,137,162,142,136,125,122,122,126,gallons
Median Gross Rent,"This indicator measures the median gross rent, which divides the gross rent distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median gross rent and one-half above the median. The data include only renter-occupied housing units paying cash rent.",A majority of Austinites rent and do not own their property. The tighter mortgage market means rental property will continue to play a large part in housing Austin’s residents. Rising rents have displaced many longtime residents and discouraged development in central Austin. Imagine Austin calls for the creation of more affordable housing by way of partnerships and incentives to bring families back into the urban core.,905,892,883,901,905,974,1008,1084,1139,1194,,USD

Residential Vacancy Rate,"This indicator measures the number of vacant or uninhabited housing units divided by the total number of units. Vacant units are excluded from the housing inventory if they are open to the elements, that is, the roof, walls, windows, and/or doors no longer protect the interior from the elements. Also excluded are vacant units with a sign that they are condemned or they are to be demolished.","Vacancy status has long been used as a basic indicator of the housing market and provides information on the stability and quality of housing for certain areas. The data is used to assess the demand for housing, to identify housing turnover within areas, and to better understand the population within the housing market over time. These data also serve to aid in the development of housing programs to meet the needs of persons at different economic levels.",8.03,8.36,8.37,8.93,7.97,8.23,6.99,7.95,8.23,8.16,,percent
