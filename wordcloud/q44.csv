"I quit eating shrimp for a lot of years because it tasted bad to me. These were farm raised shrimp. When I discovered wild caught shrimp I fell in love with it again. I live inland and getting wild caught shrimp that is affordable is not easy. Now I buy wild caught shrimp from Argentina when available and when it's on sale. Otherwise I cannot afford it.
I hope farm raised shrimp is getting better and being raised in healthy environments."
